Ada chatbot

Ada is an AI driven insights that combines cutting-edge technology, real-time market data, and advanced analysis. As web developers and creators, we actively build every detail to enhance the user experience. As a student majoring in data analysis, Kong will deeply develop and optimize the chatbot function of Ada's homepage, solve current confusion for customers through user Q&A, and collect and integrate user questions as background information for the next step of optimizing the function. The analysis of data sensitivity requires an appropriate and sufficient database as the test set, so this is a great opportunity.

As a computer science major student, Dingcheng will be committed to maintaining the security of web pages. As is well known, as a platform for designing financial transaction analysis, users' fund details and account privacy are the most vulnerable to hacker attacks and leaks. At the same time, Ada's own database used for analysis and prediction also needs to pay special attention to protection to prevent some negative commercial competition.
